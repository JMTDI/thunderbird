# Building Thunderbird with Your Changes

## Prerequisites

Since you're currently in a Linux environment but want to build for Windows, you have a few options:

### Option 1: Cross-compile for Windows (Recommended)

1. **Set up the complete source tree**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to a directory where you want to build
   cd /workspaces
   
   # Clone mozilla-central (Firefox/platform code)
   hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central
   cd mozilla-central
   
   # Clone comm-central (Thunderbird code) into the comm/ subdirectory
   hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/comm-central comm
   
   # Copy your modified files
   cp /workspaces/thunderbird/mail/base/content/contentAreaClick.js comm/mail/base/content/contentAreaClick.js
   ```

2. **Create a Windows build configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Create mozconfig file for Windows cross-compilation
   cat > mozconfig << 'EOF'
   ac_add_options --enable-project=comm/mail
   ac_add_options --target=x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
   ac_add_options --enable-cross-compile
   ac_add_options --disable-debug
   ac_add_options --enable-optimize
   EOF
   ```

3. **Install cross-compilation tools**:
   ```bash
   # This requires significant setup and may not work in all environments
   ./mach bootstrap --application-choice=thunderbird
   ```

### Option 2: Use GitHub Actions/CI (Easier)

Create a GitHub Actions workflow to build Thunderbird:

1. **Fork the Thunderbird repository**
2. **Apply your changes to the fork**
3. **Use CI to build Windows executables**

### Option 3: Build on Windows directly

If you have access to a Windows machine:

1. **Set up Windows build environment**:
   - Install Visual Studio 2019 or later
   - Install Git for Windows
   - Install Mercurial
   - Install Python 3.8+

2. **Get the source code**:
   ```cmd
   hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central
   cd mozilla-central
   hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/comm-central comm
   ```

3. **Apply your changes**:
   - Copy your modified `contentAreaClick.js` to `comm/mail/base/content/contentAreaClick.js`

4. **Configure the build**:
   ```cmd
   echo ac_add_options --enable-project=comm/mail > mozconfig
   echo ac_add_options --disable-debug >> mozconfig
   echo ac_add_options --enable-optimize >> mozconfig
   ```

5. **Build**:
   ```cmd
   ./mach build
   ```

6. **Find the executable**:
   - The built executable will be in `obj-*/dist/bin/thunderbird.exe`

## Current Status

Your changes are ready in:
- `/workspaces/thunderbird/mail/base/content/contentAreaClick.js`

The modification intercepts https:// links and opens a compose window instead of opening them in a browser.

## Testing Your Changes

Once you have a built executable, you can test by:
1. Opening Thunderbird
2. Viewing an email or document with https:// links
3. Clicking on an https:// link
4. Verifying that it opens a compose window with the link as the subject instead of opening in a browser

## Alternative: Create a Patch

If building is too complex, you can create a patch file that others can apply:

```bash
cd /workspaces/thunderbird
git diff > thunderbird-https-link-compose.patch
```

This patch can then be applied to any Thunderbird source tree.
